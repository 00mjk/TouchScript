## TouchScript â€” multitouch library for Unity
> Warning! [Please read before upgrading](https://github.com/InteractiveLab/TouchScript/wiki/Upgrading).

**TouchScript** is much more than a handful of routines to receive touch events from different sources. Inspired by iOS, TouchScript makes handling complex gesture interactions on large touch surfaces much easier. Unity and Flash implementations are developed to work together in Scaleform environment.

**TouchScript** was developed by Valentin Simonov at [Interactive Lab](http://interactivelab.ru) to:
 - Provide a reliable way to code multitouch interfaces on various devices.
 - Unify different input methods.
 - Handle complex interactions between gestures.
 - Take into account differences between a large touch surface and an iPad.

## Features
 - Easy and intuitive API.
 - Works on PC (Windows 7 and Windows 8), Mac, iOS, Android and Windows RT.
 - Doesn't require Unity Pro.
 - Supports UnityScript _(starting from version 5)_.
 - Supports various input sources: TUIO, mouse, mobile (iOS, Android, WinRT) and native Windows touch.
 - **Manages simultaneous gesture recognition within scene hierarchy (inspired by iOS).**
 - Groups touch points into clusters on big touch surfaces.
 - Comes with many commonly used gestures. Easy to write custom ones.
 - Easy to test multitouch gestures without actual multitouch device using built-in second touch simulator (activated with ALT+CLICK), [TUIOPad on iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tuiopad/id412446962) or [TUIODroid on Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tuioDroid.impl&hl=en").
