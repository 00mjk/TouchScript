## TouchScript â€” multitouch library for Unity

**TouchScript** is a multitouch library for Unity. Inspired by iOS, **TouchScript** makes handling complex gesture interactions on any touch surface much easier. 

> Warning! [Please read before upgrading](https://github.com/InteractiveLab/TouchScript/wiki/Upgrading).

## Features
- **Supports many touch input methods starting from smartphones to giant touch surfaces: Windows 7/8 touch, mobile (iOS, Android, Windows Store/Windows Phone), TUIO, mouse.**
- **Abstracts touch and gesture logic from input methods and platforms. Your touch-related code will be the same everywhere.**
- **Manages simultaneous gesture recognition within scene hierarchy.**
- **Is infinitely extensible. You can add custom input methods, gestures and hit test logic in a matter of minutes.** 
- Comes with many commonly used gestures.
- Supports all available platforms.
- Doesn't require Unity Pro.
- Highly efficient and optimized.
- Has very easy and intuitive API.
- Uses events in C# and SendMessage in UnityScript.
- Has PlayMaker actions.
- Takes into account DPI differences between a large touch surface and an iPad.
- Comes with many examples, is heavily documented with step-by-step tutorials.
- Groups touch points into clusters on big touch surfaces.
- Easy to test multitouch gestures without actual multitouch device using built-in second touch simulator (activated with ALT+CLICK), [TUIOPad on iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tuiopad/id412446962) or [TUIODroid on Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tuioDroid.impl&hl=en").
